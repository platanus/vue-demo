# Vue Demo 
This is a Rails application, initially generated using [Potassium](https://github.com/platanus/potassium) by Platanus.

This app was created for a live demo to the Platanus team. It serves as an introduction to Vue and it's basic concepts.

## Objective

The idea is to create a view with a list of products that has the following characteristics:

- For each product, show it's image, name, brand and price
- Each product should have a button to select them
- Show on the top of the list the sum of prices of the selected products

## `master` branch
This branch has some initial setup, like creation of the models and basic product index. This was done to allow efforts to focus only on the Vue part of the exercise.

## `vue-product-list` branch
This branch contains more or less the solution that was created in the live demo. It's divided in commits, each introducing different Vue concepts.
